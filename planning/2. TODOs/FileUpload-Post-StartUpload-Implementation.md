9. **Interruption Recovery** - Resume uploads after browser/network interruption
10. **Thorough and Reliable Bulk Uploading** - Database tracking of upload completion

### Duplicate & Metadata Handling

11. **Duplicate File Handling** - Preserve metadata for files with identical hashes
12. **Upload Completion Notification** - Success message with comprehensive summary
13. **Failed Upload Summary** - Categorized failure report with actionable solutions
14. **Post-Upload Detailed Review** - Searchable, sortable upload results

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### Upload Service Layer

- **`uploadService.js`** - Firebase Storage operations with atomic metadata writes
- **Firebase Integration** - Storage uploads with progress callbacks
- **Atomic Operations** - Ensure file + metadata succeed together or fail together
- **Error Classification** - Network, permission, size, and other error types

#### State Management

- **`useUploadManager.js`** - Centralized upload state and progress tracking
- **Upload State Machine** - queued → uploading → completed/failed/paused
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time file and overall progress
- **Retry Logic** - Two-pass strategy for failed uploads

#### UI Components

- **`UploadProgressModal.vue`** - Full-screen upload progress display
- **`UploadProgressBar.vue`** - Linear progress with metrics
- **`FileUploadStatus.vue`** - Individual file status indicators
- **`UploadSummaryCard.vue`** - Post-upload results summary

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Upload Service (`src/services/uploadService.js`)

```javascript
// Key responsibilities:
- Firebase Storage upload operations
- Progress callback integration
- Atomic file + metadata operations
- Upload speed calculation
- Error handling and classification
- Interruption detection and recovery
```

**Features:**

- Chunked uploads for large files
- Connection retry logic
- Upload speed metrics with rolling averages
- localStorage state persistence for recovery
- Comprehensive error categorization

#### 1.2 Upload Manager (`src/composables/useUploadManager.js`)

```javascript
// Key responsibilities:
- Upload queue state management
- Real-time progress tracking
- Pause/resume controls
- Retry queue management
- Upload metrics calculation
```

**State Structure:**

```javascript
{
  uploadState: 'idle' | 'uploading' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'error',
  currentFile: { id, name, progress, status },
  overallProgress: { completed, total, percentage },
  uploadSpeed: { bytesPerSecond, filesPerMinute },
  retryQueue: [...failedFiles],
  uploadResults: { successful: [...], failed: [...], skipped: [...] }
}
```

### Phase 2: User Interface Components

#### 2.1 Upload Progress Modal (`src/components/features/upload/UploadProgressModal.vue`)

- Full-screen overlay during upload process
- Real-time progress visualization
- Upload speed and time remaining estimates
- Pause/Resume/Cancel controls
- Individual file status list

#### 2.2 File Status Integration

- Extend existing `LazyFileItem.vue` with upload status badges
- Real-time progress indicators per file
- Error state visualization with retry buttons
- Upload completion checkmarks

#### 2.3 Upload Controls Enhancement

- Modify `FileUploadQueue.vue` "Start Upload" button behavior
- Add pause/resume toggle controls
- Conditional "Clear All" button (visible only when paused)
- Progress bar integration in queue header

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

#### 3.1 Error Handling System

**Two-Pass Upload Strategy:**

1. **Primary Pass:** Attempt all files once
2. **Retry Pass:** Cycle through failed uploads until no progress made
3. **Final Report:** Categorize remaining failures

**Error Categories:**

- Network errors (timeout, connection lost)
- Permission errors (storage access, authentication)
- File size errors (exceeds limits)
- Server errors (Firebase issues)
- Client errors (file not found, corrupted)

#### 3.2 Duplicate Handling & Metadata Preservation

```javascript
// For duplicate files (same SHA256 hash):
- Store file content once in Firebase Storage
- Create separate Firestore document for each file's metadata
- Preserve original path, name, timestamps for each instance
- Skip metadata write if identical entry already exists
```

#### 3.3 Interruption Recovery System

```javascript
// localStorage persistence:
{
  uploadSession: {
    sessionId: uuid,
    startTime: timestamp,
    files: [...uploadQueue],
    completedFiles: [...],
    failedFiles: [...],
    lastSaveTime: timestamp
  }
}
```

**Recovery Process:**

1. Detect interruption via `beforeunload` event
2. Save current state to localStorage
3. On page load, check for incomplete sessions
4. Offer user option to resume or start fresh

### Phase 4: Completion & Results

#### 4.1 Upload Completion Flow

1. **Success Modal:** Detailed completion summary

   - Total files processed
   - Data uploaded (size)
   - Time elapsed
   - Success/failure breakdown

2. **Failed Upload Report:** Categorized error summary
   - Group failures by error type
   - Provide actionable solutions
   - Retry options for recoverable errors

#### 4.2 Post-Upload Review System

**Upload Results Table:**

- Searchable and sortable file list
- Filter by status (success/failed/skipped)
- Export results to CSV
- Detailed error information per file

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration

- **File Queue System:** Leverage existing `useFileQueue.js` and `useFileQueueCore.js`
- **Authentication:** Use existing auth context and firm-based storage
- **Firebase Config:** Utilize existing Firebase service configuration
- **Deduplication:** Build on existing hash calculation and worker infrastructure

### State Synchronization

- Upload progress updates reactive state in queue components
- Real-time UI updates without blocking user interaction
- Consistent state between modal and queue views

## Technical Implementation Details

### Upload Flow Sequence

1. **Initialization:** User clicks "Start Upload" → immediate UI feedback
2. **Queue Processing:** Convert queue items to upload tasks
3. **Upload Execution:** Process files with progress callbacks
4. **Error Management:** Handle failures and populate retry queue
5. **Retry Processing:** Execute retry attempts for failed uploads
6. **Completion:** Show results summary and cleanup options

### Performance Considerations

- **Concurrent Uploads:** Configurable parallel upload limit (default: 3)
- **Progress Throttling:** Limit progress update frequency to prevent UI blocking
- **Memory Management:** Stream large files, avoid loading entire file into memory
- **Network Optimization:** Adaptive retry delays, connection pooling

### Error Recovery Strategies

- **Network Errors:** Exponential backoff retry with jitter
- **Authentication:** Token refresh and retry
- **Storage Limits:** Clear error messaging with upgrade options
- **File Corruption:** Hash verification and re-upload
