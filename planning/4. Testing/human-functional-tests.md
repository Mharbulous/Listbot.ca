## TESTING GUIDELINES FOR TESTERS

### Testing Mindset

- Think like an end user, not a developer
- Focus on whether features make sense and feel natural
- Pay attention to small details that affect user experience
- Note both positive experiences and pain points

### What to Report

- Functionality that doesn't work as expected
- UI elements that are confusing or unclear
- Performance issues or slow responses
- Visual inconsistencies or design problems
- Accessibility barriers
- Suggestions for improvement

### What NOT to Test

- Don't use browser console or developer tools (unless specifically requested)
- Don't test with artificial or unrealistic data scenarios
- Don't focus on minor pixel-level visual differences
- Don't test automated scenarios (those are covered by automated tests)

This comprehensive human testing checklist ensures the virtual folder user experience meets quality standards while providing intuitive, accessible, and efficient document organization capabilities.
