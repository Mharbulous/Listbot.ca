#Desired Column Drag-and-Drop Behavior

##  On Drag Start

  1. User clicks and holds on a column header (e.g., Column B)
  2. All column positions are captured and frozen as static drop zones
  3. Visual feedback: Column B shows it's being dragged (opacity, shadow)
  4. The dragged column leaves a "gap" in its original position

## During Drag - Moving the Column

 When mouse enters a new zone:
  - The columns instantly rearrange to show where the dragged column would land
  - The dragged column "gap" moves to the new position
  - All other columns shift to accommodate the new position
  - Crucially: The drop zones themselves never move - they stay frozen at their original positions


## Insertion logic

  - If hovered zone is LEFT of dragged column's original position → insert BEFORE hovered zone (to the left)
  - If hovered zone is RIGHT of dragged column's original position → insert AFTER hovered zone (to the right)

Example Scenarios:

  Starting order: [A | B | C | D | E] (C is being dragged)

  Mouse hovers over zone B (B's original position):
  - Should show: [A | C | B | D | E]

  Mouse hovers over zone E (E's original position):
  - Should show: [A | B | D | E | C ]

  Mouse returns to hover over zone C (C's original position):
  - Should restore: [A | B | C | D | E] (back to starting state)
