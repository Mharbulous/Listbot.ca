## EDRM Framework Context

The Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) is the industry-standard framework for managing electronically stored information (ESI) throughout litigation. ListBot's navigation structure directly mirrors the eight client-facing EDRM stages (Information Governance remains client-side):

1. **Identify** - Locate potentially relevant ESI
2. **Preserve** - Protect data from alteration/destruction ✅ **Complete**
3. **Collect** - Defensibly gather preserved ESI 🏗️ **Building**
4. **Process** - Reduce volume and normalize formats
5. **Review** - Evaluate for relevance and privilege 🏗️ **Building**
6. **Analysis** - Uncover patterns and strategic insights
7. **Produce** - Deliver responsive documents to opposing parties
8. **Present** - Display evidence at proceedings

The EDRM stages form the core document discovery workflow, while Facts, Characters, Law, Theory, and Pleadings features represent the **litigation preparation layer** that helps lawyers understand and organize their case strategy independent of the mechanical e-discovery workflow.
