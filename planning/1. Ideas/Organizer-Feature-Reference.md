# Organizer Feature Reference Document

## Overview

The **Organizer** is an AI-powered document discovery and organization system designed to help users find previously uploaded files through intelligent categorization and flexible viewing interfaces. Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.

## Core Purpose

**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.

**Target Use Cases**:

- Finding bank statements by institution and account details
- Locating photographs by location and date
- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)
- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation

## Architecture Overview

### Storage Strategy

- **File Storage**: Continues using Storage 1 (existing Firebase Storage)
- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection for organization metadata
- **Reference Architecture**: Evidence entries point to files via fileHash
- **No File Duplication**: Multiple evidence entries can reference same stored file
- **Processing States**: Evidence tracks document through processing workflow

### Processing Workflow

1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)
2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly
3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review
4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples

## Tag System Design

### Category Structure

- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., "Document Type", "Date", "Institution")
- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., "Invoice", "Statement", "Contract")
- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability

### Tag Management

- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options
- **Configurable Mutual Exclusivity**: Categories can be set as mutually exclusive (one tag per document) or allow multiple tags
  - Examples: Document Type (mutually exclusive), Keywords (multiple allowed)
  - User configurable per category during creation/editing
- **Add/Delete Operations**:
  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents
  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files
- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options

### AI Processing Approach

- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities
- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves
- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints
- **Enhanced AI Alternatives**: AI stores comprehensive alternative options (no cap), UI displays up to 3 choices with individual confidence levels
- **Rich Data Structure**: AI alternatives stored with confidence levels, human overrides, and reviewer attribution
- **Priority-Based Processing**: All processed documents enter review queue ordered by confidence (lowest first)
- **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Uses previously reviewed examples to improve accuracy over time

## User Interface Design

### Flat View (Default)

- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags
- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → "Show in Folders" creates virtual folder structure

### Virtual Folder View

- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels
- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal
- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)

### File Actions (KISS Principle)

- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)
- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)
- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow

## Streamlined AI Workflow (Updated August 30, 2025)

### Immediate AI Tag Application

- **Direct Application**: AI processes documents and applies tags immediately without interrupting user workflow
- **Visual Distinction**: Clear visual differentiation between AI-applied and human-reviewed tags
- **Non-Disruptive Experience**: Users receive immediate value while maintaining natural review opportunities

### AI Tag Visual Design System

- **AI-Applied Tags**: Colored text and border with white background for unreviewed AI suggestions
- **Human-Reviewed Tags**: White text and border with colored background after human approval
- **In-Context Review**: Users can review and approve tags naturally within the document interface
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual cues indicate tag source and review status

### Enhanced Data Structure

- **Multi-Suggestion Support**: AI provides multiple tag options per category with individual confidence levels
- **Confidence Tracking**: Individual confidence levels stored for each suggested tag
- **Human Override Recording**: Tracks approval decisions and reviewer attribution for audit trails
- **Status Tracking**: Records tag lifecycle from AI suggestion to human approval

### Learning Approach

- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models
- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future processing
- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples
- **Performance Analytics**: Rich data enables analysis of AI accuracy vs human decisions over time

## BATES Numbering System

### Legal Workflow Integration

- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints
- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings
- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]
  - Examples: "Roberts-0001", "1.22-0003", "Plaintiff-1.22-0003"

### Numbering Rules

- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering
- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers "pencilled in" after processing, "inked" after first print
- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number
- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked
- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused

### Deduplication Integration

- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads
- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers

## Integration with Document Processing Workflow

### Evidence Database Role

- **Central Registry**: All processed documents tracked in Evidence database
- **Processing Status**: Tracks files through upload → split → merge pipeline
- **Quality Tracking**: Records hasAllPages and completeness status
- **Multi-Storage Support**: References files across uploads/split/merged folders

### Version 1.0 Preparation

- Evidence schema includes processing fields (unused in v1.0)
- Storage reference structure supports future split/merged folders
- Processing status defaults to "uploaded" for all v1.0 entries
- Future versions update these fields without schema changes

## Technical Implementation Approach

### AI Integration

- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing
- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally
- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves

### Data Storage

- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure
- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection `/firms/{firmId}/evidence/`
- **Storage References**: Evidence documents reference files via:
  - `storageRef.storage`: Which storage folder (uploads/split/merged)
  - `storageRef.fileHash`: Unique file identifier
- **Display References**: Evidence points to specific metadata records via:
  - `sourceID.metadataHash`: Points to chosen sourceMetadata record
  - `sourceID.folderPath`: User-chosen folder path from that record
- **Processing Metadata**: Evidence tracks isProcessed, hasAllPages, processingStage
- **Tag Storage**: Separated by source (tagsByAI, tagsByHuman arrays)
- **Firm Isolation**: All data scoped by firm ID (solo users: firmId === userId)

### Performance Considerations

- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking
- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing
- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations
