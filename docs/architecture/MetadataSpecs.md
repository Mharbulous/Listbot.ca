# File Metadata for Evidence Management Applications

**Digital evidence metadata is crucial for establishing authenticity, chain of custody, and forensic integrity in legal proceedings.** This report provides technical specifications for 17 common file types lawyers encounter, covering metadata standards, reliability during transfers, and forensic value. Understanding which metadata survives email attachments, cloud uploads, and format conversions is essential for preserving evidentiary value.

## Metadata comparison table

| File Type | Metadata Standard | Key Fields | Reliability | Forensic Notes | Extraction Tools |
|-----------|------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| **PDF** | XMP + Document Information Dictionary | Author, Creator, Producer, CreationDate, ModDate, DocumentID, InstanceID, revision history (xmpMM:History), time zone offsets | Survives email/transfers; metadata streams may exist unencrypted even when document is encrypted; writers may update only one metadata stream creating discrepancies | Time zone offsets reveal editing location; DocumentID/InstanceID track version lineage; xmpMM:History provides complete audit trail; Creator/Producer mismatch reveals conversion workflows | ExifTool, Apache Tika |
| **JPG/JPEG** | EXIF, XMP, IPTC-IIM | DateTime Original, GPS coordinates, camera make/model, device serial number, dimensions, camera settings (ISO, aperture, shutter speed), software, thumbnail | Survives USB transfers and email attachments with 100% integrity; social media and chat apps strip metadata; image editors often damage EXIF due to TIFF pointer vulnerabilities | GPS proves physical presence; timestamps build timelines; device identifiers link images to specific cameras; edit history reveals manipulation through software tags and thumbnail mismatches | ExifTool, Magnet AXIOM |
| **PNG** | XMP (in iTXt chunks), EXIF (non-standard) | Creation date/time, author/creator, description, software, color profile, dimensions, text annotations | USB/email preserve metadata; Adobe CS5/CS6 had bugs stripping XMP (fixed in later versions); social media removes metadata chunks; lacks standardized EXIF compared to JPEG | Software tags reveal editing history; lacks GPS data making it less valuable for geolocation; PNG format sometimes used to hide evidence by changing extensions | ExifTool, Exiv2 |
| **TIFF** | EXIF, XMP, IPTC-IIM | DateTime Original/Modified, GPS Sub-IFD, camera make/model, dimensions, camera settings, artist/copyright, software, thumbnail | Preserves metadata well through direct transfers; metadata in IFD structures can corrupt if apps don't decode/encode properly; TIFF's lossless format preferred for archival/forensic workflows | GPS provides precise geolocation; MakerNote tags contain manufacturer-specific settings for device fingerprinting; multiple timestamps reveal creation vs. modification timelines | ExifTool, FTK |
| **DOC/DOCX** | Office Open XML (Core/Extended Properties), OLE | Author, LastModifiedBy, revision number, Created/Modified timestamps, Company, Manager, TotalTime (edit time), Template, Application, word/page counts | Internal metadata survives email attachments (ZIP/OLE containers); cloud platforms may strip metadata; saving as different format may lose some properties | Revision number and edit time track document evolution; LastModifiedBy vs. Author reveals multi-user editing; Track Changes and comments may remain hidden; Company field reveals organizational origin | OfficeDissector, Belkasoft Evidence Center |
| **XLS/XLSX** | Office Open XML (Core/Extended Properties), OLE | Author, LastModifiedBy, Created/Modified dates, Revision, Company, Application, TotalTime, WorksheetNames, NamedRanges, HiddenSheets, SharedDoc | Internal metadata survives email attachments; Excel-specific extended properties preserved; metadata persists through transfers unless actively stripped | Hidden sheets and cells metadata exposes concealed data; revision tracking preserves formula change history; NamedRanges can reveal complex financial models; timestamps aid timeline reconstruction | ExifTool, Apache Tika |
| **PPT/PPTX** | Office Open XML (Core/Extended Properties), OLE | Author, LastModifiedBy, Created/Modified timestamps, Revision, Company, TotalTime, Slides count, HiddenSlides, Notes, MMClips (multimedia count), PresentationFormat | Metadata persists in email attachments within ZIP/OLE container; speaker notes often overlooked during redaction; cloud platforms typically preserve core metadata | Hidden slides metadata reveals censored content; speaker notes contain unintended disclosures; MMClips metadata identifies embedded audio/video; slide modification timestamps expose tampering | Belkasoft Evidence Center, Metadata Extraction Tool |
| **TXT** | File system metadata only | Timestamps (Created/Birth, Modified, Accessed, Changed) at 100-nanosecond precision (NTFS) or 2-second (FAT32), file attributes, size, permissions, optional BOM for encoding | Survives transfers with forensic tools (FTK Imager); lost during email attachments (creation time reset), cloud uploads (timestamps may update), basic copy tools | MACB timeline analysis critical for provenance; modification date older than creation date indicates copy; timestamp manipulation tools can alter to second-precision (truncated values indicate tampering in NTFS) | ExifTool, FTK Imager |
| **RTF** | RTF control words/tags (no formal standard) | Author, Company, Title, Subject, Keywords, CreationTime, RevisionTime, Comments, Version; often minimal or absent compared to native Office formats | RTF created from scratch typically contains no internal metadata beyond filesystem timestamps; converting DOC/DOCX to RTF transfers some metadata as control words; plaintext format makes metadata easily editable/removable | Limited forensic value due to sparse embedded metadata; conversion from DOC/DOCX to RTF indicates intentional metadata reduction; embedded OLE object metadata may retain rich metadata from source applications | ExifTool, Apache Tika |
| **MSG** | MAPI Properties (Extended MAPI) | PR_CLIENT_SUBMIT_TIME, PR_MESSAGE_DELIVERY_TIME, PR_CREATION_TIME (resets on export), PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME, PR_SENDER_SMTP_ADDRESS, PR_CONVERSATION_INDEX, PR_TRANSPORT_MESSAGE_HEADERS, PR_INTERNET_MESSAGE_ID, attachment timestamps at 100-nanosecond resolution | PR_CREATION_TIME resets when exported from mailbox to .msg file; PR_CLIENT_SUBMIT_TIME and PR_MESSAGE_DELIVERY_TIME remain reliable; attachment timestamps survive via Outlook/Exchange but not Outlook Web Access; vulnerable to manipulation via MFCMAPI | PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME mismatches reveal tampering; PR_CONVERSATION_INDEX timestamps show reply creation timing; 0x5D09001E property proves SendAs permission misuse; attachment timestamps enable date forgery detection | MFCMAPI, OutlookSpy |
| **EML** | RFC 5322 Headers, MIME | From, To/Cc/Bcc, Date, Subject, Message-ID, Received (routing chain with IPs/timestamps), X-Originating-IP, X-Mailer, Return-Path, MIME headers | Headers survive basic transfers as plain ASCII text; forwarding as attachment may nest or lose headers depending on client; some clients strip X-headers; converting EML↔MSG may lose X-headers | Received headers show complete routing path with timestamps/IPs proving authenticity; Message-ID verifies uniqueness; X-Originating-IP traces sender location; discrepancies between Date and Received timestamps indicate tampering | Aid4Mail Forensic, MailXaminer |
| **MP3** | ID3 tags (v2.3, v2.4) | Title, Artist, Album, Recording Date (TDRC), Encoding Software (TSSE), Bit Rate, Sample Rate, Comments | ID3v2 metadata survives file transfers/cloud uploads well but vulnerable during format conversions (especially MP3→WAV) where tags are frequently lost | Recording timestamps establish timeline; encoding software field identifies creation tools and potential tampering; embedded ownership data links files to sources; lack of device metadata may indicate re-encoding to hide edit history | ExifTool, MediaInfo |
| **WAV** | BWF (Broadcast Wave Format) with bext chunk, INFO List Chunk, iXML chunk | Originator, OriginatorReference, OriginationDate/Time, CodingHistory (encoding processes), Description, UMID, TimeReference, MD5 checksums | BWF metadata designed for archival use and resists corruption better than ID3, but not universally supported—many tools ignore or strip bext chunks during conversions; WAV→MP3 conversions typically require manual metadata re-entry | Origination Date/Time provide precise recording timestamps; CodingHistory documents every processing step revealing manipulation history; Originator establishes chain of custody; MD5 checksums verify audio bitstream integrity | BWF MetaEdit, ExifTool |

| **MOV** | QuickTime atoms (moov, mvhd, tkhd, mdia, udta), XMP | MediaCreateDate, ModificationDate, duration, GPS location (proprietary GPS track atoms), camera info, resolution, frame rate, audio/video codecs, device identifiers, color metadata | Metadata survives direct transfers unchanged; transcoding to MP4 may preserve most moov structure but loses vendor-specific atoms; social media strips GPS and device-specific data | Timestamp verification through multiple date fields indicates editing; GPS tracks provide continuous location data for moving recordings; device fingerprinting via manufacturer atoms identifies camera model/serial | ExifTool, MediaInfo |
| **AVI** | RIFF (Resource Interchange File Format) with INFO chunks, XMP, EXIF in LIST structures | Creation date (IDIT, often unreliable), Software (ISFT), Artist, Copyright, Comments, resolution, frame rate, codec, duration, Engineer/Technician | RIFF INFO metadata often incomplete or absent in camera-generated AVI files; transcoding frequently strips INFO chunks entirely; limited standardization means vendors implement metadata differently; social media removes all INFO metadata | Software identification reveals editing tools; IDIT often shows encoding time rather than capture time (questionable reliability); device-specific JUNK chunks contain manufacturer data for source verification; limited GPS metadata | ExifTool, MediaInfo |
| **ZIP** | PKWARE ZIP File Format Specification (Central/Local Directory headers) | Timestamps (MS-DOS 2-second precision, optional NTFS Extra Field 100-nanosecond precision), compression method, CRC-32 checksums, file attributes, version made by, compressed/uncompressed sizes, file paths | File system timestamps depend on compression tool—WinZip preserves creation dates by default, WinRAR requires option enabled, 7-Zip strips creation timestamps unless command-line parameters used | MS-DOS timestamps establish minimum archive creation date; NTFS Extra Field timestamps provide high-precision provenance; CRC-32 checksums prove file integrity; version/creator OS identifies archiving tool and source environment | 7-Zip, WinRAR |

## Critical considerations for evidence handling

**Metadata preservation requires forensic-grade tools.** Standard file operations often alter or destroy critical timestamps and embedded metadata. Email attachments typically reset creation timestamps, social media platforms strip 80-95% of metadata for privacy and storage optimization, and basic copy utilities lose precision in timestamp fields.

**Chain of custody documentation should include** the specific tools and versions used for collection (FTK Imager, WinZip with settings documented), original file hashes (MD5/SHA-256) calculated before analysis, and complete transfer method details. Converting MSG files to EML or transcoding videos creates new metadata that overwrites forensically valuable original data.

**Authentication verification compares** internal embedded metadata against file system timestamps to detect inconsistencies indicating tampering. For images, thumbnail mismatches with main image reveal editing. For documents, revision counts and edit times validate claimed document age. For emails, Date header discrepancies with Received timestamps suggest manipulation.

**High-value forensic fields include** GPS coordinates (images, videos), device serial numbers and identifiers (images, videos, audio), precise timestamps with time zones (documents, emails), revision history and edit tracking (documents, PDFs), routing headers with IP addresses (emails), and CRC checksums for integrity verification (ZIP archives, WAV audio).

**Platform-specific risks:** WhatsApp/Telegram in image mode strip metadata, while document mode preserves it. Adobe CS5/CS6 had XMP-stripping bugs for PNG files. Outlook Web Access doesn't preserve attachment timestamps like desktop Outlook. Cloud services treating TIFF as image format optimize and strip metadata versus those treating it as document format.
