# Old Upload Page - Comprehensive Documentation

## Overview

The ListBot application's original upload page (at `/upload` route) is a sophisticated file upload system designed for law firms and professional services. It provides efficient file processing, deduplication, real-time progress tracking, and comprehensive audit logging with power-outage detection capabilities.

This document describes the **current/old implementation** as it exists before the development of the new upload page (at `/testing` route). For the new upload page development plan, see `docs/2025-11-10-New-Upload-Page.md`.

## Page Description

### User Interface & Layout

#### Initial State (Empty Dropzone)
The upload page begins with a clean, minimal interface focused entirely on the upload action:

- **Clean, centered layout** with a large drag-and-drop zone occupying most of the screen
- **Cloud upload icon** centrally positioned above instructional text reading "Drag and drop files or folders here"
- **Secondary instruction text** "or choose files using the buttons below"
- **Two prominent action buttons:**
  - **"SELECT FILES"** (blue, primary action) - opens file picker for individual file selection
  - **"SELECT FOLDER"** (gray, secondary action) - opens folder picker using HTML5 `webkitdirectory` API
- **Minimal visual clutter** - focuses user attention solely on the upload action
- **Simple heading** "Upload" in top-left corner of the page
- **Route**: `localhost:5173/#/upload`

#### Folder Upload Options Modal
When a folder is selected (via button or drag-and-drop), an intelligent **pre-upload analysis modal** appears offering upload strategy options:

**Modal Title**: "Folder Upload Options" with folder icon

**Two Upload Strategies** (radio button selection):

1. **"This folder only"**
   - Processes files in root folder only (no recursion)
   - Shows: "{X} files in this folder totalling {Y}MB ({Z}MB possible duplicates)"
   - Example: "720 files in this folder totalling 4.7MB (0MB possible duplicates)"

2. **"Include subfolders"** (default selected)
   - Recursively processes all nested folders
   - Shows: "{X} files in {Y} folders totalling {Z}MB ({W}MB possible duplicates)"
   - Example: "720 files in 135 folders totalling 380.3MB (5.4MB possible duplicates)"

**Smart Features**:
- **Real-time statistics** calculated instantly during folder analysis
- **Duplicate estimation** based on size-based pre-filtering
- **Hardware-calibrated time estimate** displayed at bottom left (e.g., "Time estimate: 1.6s")
- **Action buttons** at bottom right:
  - "CANCEL" (gray) - dismisses modal and returns to dropzone
  - "CONTINUE" (blue) - proceeds with selected strategy
