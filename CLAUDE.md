## High-Level Architecture

### Authentication System

The app uses a sophisticated Firebase Auth system with explicit state machine pattern to handle timing issues common in Firebase Auth integrations:

**Auth States**: `uninitialized` → `initializing` → `authenticated` | `unauthenticated` | `error`

**Key Components**:

- `stores/auth.js` - Pinia store with state machine for auth
- `services/authService.js` - Firebase Auth operations
- `router/guards/auth.js` - Route protection
- `components/features/auth/LoginForm.vue` - Login interface

**Solo Firm Architecture**: Every user automatically gets a "solo firm" where `firmId === userId`, providing consistent data patterns and easy upgrade path to multi-user firms.

### File Upload & Processing System

Core feature for uploading and processing files with sophisticated time estimation and deduplication:

**Key Components**:

- `views/FileUpload.vue` - Main upload interface
- `components/features/upload/` - Upload-related components
  - `FileUploadQueue.vue` - Queue management and progress display
  - `FolderOptionsDialog.vue` - Upload configuration with time estimates
  - `ProcessingProgressModal.vue` - Real-time progress tracking
  - `UploadDropzone.vue` - Drag/drop interface
- `composables/` - Reusable logic
  - `useFileQueue.js` - File queue management and processing coordination
  - `useQueueDeduplication.js` - Duplicate detection and hash processing
  - `useFolderOptions.js` - Folder analysis and path parsing optimization
  - `useWebWorker.js` & `useWorkerManager.js` - Worker management
- `workers/fileHashWorker.js` - Background SHA-256 hash calculation
- `utils/fileAnalysis.js` - 3-phase time estimation and file metrics

**Processing Pipeline**:

1. **File Selection** → Folder analysis and preprocessing
2. **Estimation** → 3-phase time prediction with directory complexity
3. **Queueing** → Size-based filtering and duplicate detection
4. **Processing** → Background hash calculation with progress tracking
5. **Upload** → Firebase storage with deduplication

### Component Architecture

- **Layout**: `AppSidebar.vue`, `AppHeader.vue` provide main navigation
- **Base Components**: Reusable UI components in `components/base/`
- **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components in `components/features/`
- **Views**: Page-level components in `views/`

### Data Flow Patterns

1. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth → Auth Store → Route Guards → Components
2. **File Processing**: File Selection → Folder Analysis → Time Estimation → Queue → Deduplication → Worker Processing → Upload
3. **State Management**: Pinia stores manage global state, composables handle component-level logic

### File Processing Flow Details

1. **File/Folder Selection**: User drops files or selects folder
2. **Folder Options Analysis** (if folder):
   - Single-pass path parsing for all files
   - Directory statistics calculation (depth, count)
   - Size-based duplicate candidate identification
   - 3-phase time estimation with directory complexity
3. **Queue Management**: Files added to processing queue with metadata
4. **Deduplication Processing**:
   - Size-based pre-filtering (unique sizes skip hashing)
   - Web Worker hash calculation for duplicate candidates
   - Progress tracking with phase-based updates
5. **Upload Coordination**: Processed files uploaded to Firebase Storage

## Demo Organization System

The codebase includes a structured development demonstration system in `src/dev-demos/` for testing and showcasing features:

- **Demo Views**: Full-page demos in `src/dev-demos/views/` (e.g., LazyLoadingDemo.vue)
- **Demo Routes**: Development-only routes under `/dev/*` (e.g., `/dev/lazy-loading`)
- **Demo Components**: Reusable demo infrastructure (`DemoContainer.vue`, performance tracking)
- **Environment-Aware**: Demos only load in development mode
- **Access**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5174/#/dev` for demo index

Key demos include lazy loading performance testing with <0.01ms placeholder rendering verification and realistic test data generation.

## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication Timing Solutions

The auth system solves Firebase Auth's race condition issues where `onAuthStateChanged` fires multiple times during initialization:

```javascript
// Proper auth state checking
if (!authStore.isInitialized) {
  return; // Wait for auth determination
}

if (authStore.isAuthenticated) {
  // User is definitely logged in
}
```

### File Processing & Estimation System

**Hardware-Calibrated Prediction System:**
The system uses hardware-specific calibration to provide accurate time predictions:

1. **Phase 1: File Analysis** (Filtering)

   - Size-based duplicate detection and file categorization
   - Consistent ~60ms regardless of file count
   - Path parsing and directory structure analysis
   - Duplicate candidate identification

2. **Phase 2: Hash Processing** (Hardware-Calibrated)

   - SHA-256 calculation for duplicate detection
   - Formula: `35 + (6.5 × candidates) + (0.8 × sizeMB)` × hardware calibration factor
   - Uses stored hardware performance factor (H-factor) from actual measurements
   - Accounts for both computational and I/O overhead

3. **Phase 3: UI Rendering** (Hardware & Complexity Calibrated)
   - DOM updates and progress visualization
   - Formula: `50 + (0.52 × files) + (45 × avgDepth)` × hardware calibration factor
   - Directory structure complexity impacts rendering performance

**Path Parsing Optimization:**

- Single preprocessing pass eliminates 80% of redundant path parsing
- Calculates all metrics simultaneously: directory count, depth statistics, folder detection
- Optimized from 5+ separate parsing operations to 1 consolidated operation

**File Deduplication Strategy:**

- **Size-based pre-filtering**: Files with unique sizes skip hash calculation entirely
- **Hash-based verification**: Only files with identical sizes undergo SHA-256 hashing
- **Firestore integration**: Hashes serve as document IDs for automatic database-level deduplication
- **Efficient processing**: Typically 60-80% of files skip expensive hash calculation

**Hardware Performance Calibration:**
The system automatically calibrates to hardware performance during folder analysis:

- **H-Factor Calculation**: Files processed per millisecond during folder analysis
- **Automatic Storage**: Performance measurements stored in localStorage
- **Continuous Improvement**: Uses recent measurements for better accuracy
- **Hardware-Specific**: Adapts to different CPU speeds and system performance

### Multi-App SSO Integration

Part of a larger SSO architecture - when testing multi-app features, use the `dev:*` commands with proper localhost domain mapping. All apps share identical Firebase configuration for seamless authentication.

### Route Structure

- Hash-based routing for Firebase hosting compatibility
- Route guards protect authenticated areas
- Meta flags control authentication requirements
- Lazy loading for all route components

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality & Linting

**CRITICAL**: You MUST always delegate all linting and code beautification tasks to the specialized `beautifier` agent. When delegating to the beautifier:

1. **Always specify the exact files** that need to be reviewed/formatted
2. **Use the Task tool** with `subagent_type: "beautifier"`
3. **Provide clear file paths** - never use vague instructions like "check all files"
4. **Examples of proper delegation**:
   - "Review and format these specific files: `src/components/LoginForm.vue`, `src/core/stores/auth.js`"
   - "Fix linting errors in `src/utils/fileAnalysis.js` and `src/composables/useFileQueue.js`"

**Never attempt to manually fix linting or formatting issues** - always use the specialized agent.

### Local SSO Testing Setup

Add to hosts file for multi-app development:

```
127.0.0.1 intranet.localhost
127.0.0.1 bookkeeping.localhost
127.0.0.1 files.localhost
```

### Key Files to Understand

- `docs/authentication.md` - Comprehensive auth system documentation
- `src/main.js` - App initialization and auth store setup
- `src/App.vue` - Main layout with auth state handling
- `vite.config.js` - Build configuration with Vuetify integration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and script commands

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with Vitest for composables and utilities
- E2E tests specifically for SSO functionality across apps
- Manual testing checklist includes cross-app authentication flows

### Environment Configuration

Firebase configuration required in `.env` file (see `.env.example` template). All related apps must use identical Firebase project configuration for SSO to function.

## Performance Optimizations

### Web Workers

File hashing and processing operations run in background workers to prevent UI blocking during large file uploads.

### Lazy Loading

- Route components are dynamically imported
- Auth service imports are lazy-loaded to prevent circular dependencies
- Large dependencies loaded on-demand

### Deduplication Efficiency

Hash-based deduplication eliminates redundant storage and processing of identical files.

## Security Implementation

### Firestore Security Rules

- Users can only access their own data (`firmId === userId` for solo users)
- Files use hash-based document IDs for immutable storage
- Firm-based access control ready for future multi-user features

### Authentication Security

- Firebase Auth handles all identity verification
- Automatic token refresh and session validation
- Secure logout clears all client-side data
- Route guards prevent unauthorized access

## Performance Testing & Analysis

### Speed Test Data Collection

The `docs/speed_tests/` directory contains tools for analyzing file processing performance:

**Data Collection Process:**

1. Run file processing operations in the browser
2. Copy console log output from browser DevTools console
3. Save console output as `.md` file (e.g., `3_Raw_ConsoleData.md`)

**Analysis Scripts:**

- **`parse_console_log.py`**: Parses browser console logs into structured CSV data

  ```bash
  python parse_console_log.py 3_Raw_ConsoleData.md
  ```

  - Generates `3_FolderAnalysisData.csv` (file metrics)
  - Generates `3_TestSpeedData.csv` (3-stage timing data)

- **`analyze_3stage_data.py`**: Analyzes performance data and provides prediction coefficients
  ```bash
  python analyze_3stage_data.py
  ```

**Hardware-Calibrated Performance System:**
The system uses real-time hardware calibration for accurate predictions:

**Hardware Calibration Process:**

1. **Initial Measurement**: During folder analysis, measure files processed per millisecond (H-factor)
2. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare against baseline H-factor of 1.61 files/ms
3. **Calibration Multiplier**: Calculate hardware-specific adjustment factor
4. **Prediction Scaling**: Apply multiplier to base prediction formulas

**Key Benefits:**

- **Hardware-Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts to different CPU speeds and system performance
- **Real-Time Calibration**: Uses actual measurements rather than static formulas
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves accuracy over time with more measurements
- **No Negative Constants**: Eliminates mathematical edge cases from legacy system
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Single prediction system focused on hardware performance

**Calibration Data Storage:**

- **localStorage Integration**: Stores up to 50 recent measurements
- **Rolling Average**: Uses last 10 measurements for current predictions
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors H-factor trends and system performance
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Prevents storage bloat with measurement limits

## Important Notes

- **File Processing**: Large operations run in Web Workers to maintain UI responsiveness
- **State Machine**: Always check `authStore.isInitialized` before rendering auth-dependent content
- **Firm Context**: All data access is scoped by firm ID (currently userId for solo users)
- **Cross-App Testing**: Use dedicated dev commands for SSO testing across multiple apps
- **Firebase Consistency**: All apps in SSO architecture must use identical Firebase configuration
- IMPORTANT: Always use the plan-reviewer agent on EVERY written implementation plan.
- Vitest test suites should be saved in the "tests" folder.
