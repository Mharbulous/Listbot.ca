# CLAUDE.md - ListBot App

This file provides high-level directives for working on the ListBot repository.
This file is **lean by design**. Detailed documentation is in the `/docs` directory.

## 1. CRITICAL: Core Directives

**You MUST follow these rules at all times.**

1.  **AGENT: Linting:** You MUST delegate all linting and code beautification to the `beautifier` agent.
    - _Example_: "Task: Use the `beautifier` agent to fix linting in `src/views/FileUpload.vue`."
2.  **DEV STAGE: Early (No Legacy)**
    - Development is in a pre-alpha stage.
    - **There is NO existing user data.**
    - You MUST NOT write migration scripts.
    - You MUST implement schema changes or refactors _directly_.
    - Firestore and Storage can be wiped clean at any time. Focus on the _optimal_ architecture, not backward compatibility.
3.  **TERMINOLOGY:** The file processing lifecycle has very specific terminology (Original, Source, Upload, Batesed, etc.). You MUST consult `@docs/architecture/file-lifecycle.md` to ensure you use this terminology correctly in all code, comments, and UI text.
4.  **DEDUPLICATION TERMINOLOGY:** File deduplication uses precise terminology that you MUST follow:
    - **"duplicate"** or **"duplicates"**: Files with identical content (hash value) and core metadata (name, size, modified date) where folder path variations have no informational value.  Duplicates are not uploaded and their metadata is not copied.
    - **"redundant"**: Hash-verified duplicates awaiting removal. Files transition from "duplicate" status to "redundant" after hash verification confirms identical content. Redundant files are removed during Stage 1 pre-filter of the next batch, creating a two-phase cleanup lifecycle.
    - **"copy"** or **"copies"**: Files with the same hash value but different file metadata that IS meaningful.  Copies are not uploaded to storage, but their metadata is recorded for informational value.
    - **"best"** or **"primary"**: The file with the most meaningful metadata that will be uploaded to storage their metadata recorded for informational value.
    - **"file metadata"**: Filesystem metadata (name, size, modified date, path) that does not affect hash value    
5.  **TESTS:** All Vitest unit/component tests MUST be located in the `/tests` folder.

## 5. Key Implementation Concepts (High-Level)

This is a brief overview of core concepts. For details, see the `@docs` above.

- **Auth State Machine**: Always check `authStore.isInitialized` before `authStore.isAuthenticated`. The system uses an explicit state machine to prevent Firebase race conditions.
- **"Solo Firm" Architecture**: All data is scoped by a `firmId`. For solo users, the `firmId` is **always** equal to the `userId`. This is a fundamental data model rule.
- **Web Worker Hashing**: File hashing (BLAKE3) is CPU-intensive and MUST run in a web worker (`@/workers/fileHashWorker.js`) to avoid blocking the UI.
- **Hash-Based Deduplication**: Files are deduplicated.
  1.  Files with unique sizes _skip_ hashing.
  2.  Only files with matching sizes are hashed.
  3.  The final BLAKE3 hash is used as the document ID in Firestore, providing automatic, database-level deduplication.
- **Multi-App SSO**: All apps (ListBot, Intranet, Files) share a **single, identical Firebase project config** to enable seamless SSO.

## 6. Troubleshooting: File Editing Issues

### Problem: Edit Tool "String to replace not found" Errors

**Symptom**: The `Edit` tool fails with "String to replace not found in file" even though you can see the exact text when reading the file.

**Root Cause**: Character encoding mismatch - the file contains characters (especially emojis like ✅, 🤖, etc.) that display the same but have different byte encodings.

### How to Identify This Issue

1. **Use `cat -A` to reveal hidden characters**:
   ```bash
   cat "path/to/file.md" | sed -n '100,110p' | cat -A
   ```

   **What you'll see**:
   - Display shows: `- ✅ **Item**: Description`
   - `cat -A` shows: `- ^E **Item**: Description`

   The `^E` (or other control characters) reveals the actual byte encoding is different from the checkmark emoji you're trying to match.

2. **Check specific line numbers**:
   ```bash
   sed -n '750,752p' "path/to/file.md" | cat -A
   ```

### How to Fix It

**Solution 1: Use `sed` with line number targeting** (Recommended)
```bash
# Replace entire line at specific line number
sed -i '750s/.*/- ✅ **UX4**: New content here/' "path/to/file.md"

# Insert new line after line 750
sed -i '750a- ✅ **UX5**: Additional content' "path/to/file.md"
```

**Why this works**: Targets the line number instead of trying to match the encoded characters.

**Solution 2: Rewrite the entire file section**
If multiple lines need updating, use the `Write` tool to rewrite the entire file with consistent encoding.

**Solution 3: Remove problematic characters**
If emojis aren't essential, use plain text:
```markdown
- [x] **UX4**: Description
```

### Prevention

- **Be consistent with emojis**: If using emojis in markdown, stick to one method (Edit tool or `sed`)
- **Test first**: When editing files with emojis, try a small edit first to verify encoding compatibility
- **Use line numbers**: When you know the exact line to change, prefer `sed` with line numbers over string matching

### Path Format Notes

- **Windows with Git Bash**: Use forward slashes with drive letter: `C:/Users/name/file.md`
- **Relative paths**: `./planning/file.md` (from project root)
- **Absolute paths preferred** for reliability in Windows environments
- DO NOT modify any files from the production branch!  If asked to commit changes from the production branch you should instead switch to the main branch and commit from the main branch. Fuller explanation is provided here:  docs\hosting\2025-11-16-Promotion.md

## 7. Technical Best Practices

**You MUST follow these best practices to avoid common pitfalls and bugs.**

### Vue 3 TypeScript Ref Typing

- **CORRECT**: Use proper TypeScript typing for refs with objects:
  ```typescript
  const user = ref<User>()  // for optional
  const user = ref<User | null>(null)  // for explicitly nullable
  ```
- **INCORRECT**: Avoid casting empty objects as types:
  ```typescript
  const user = ref({} as User)  // ❌ Bypasses type safety, leads to undefined property access
  ```
- **Why**: Casting empty objects bypasses TypeScript's type safety and leads to undefined property access at runtime.

### Tailwind CSS Directive Order

- **CRITICAL**: Tailwind directives MUST be imported in this exact order:
  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```
- Then import the CSS file **after Vue** in `main.js`:
  ```javascript
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import './style.css'  // Import after Vue
  ```

### Vuetify + Tailwind Framework Conflicts

- **Issue**: Applying utility classes from both frameworks on the same elements causes specificity conflicts.
- **Solutions**:
  1. Use Tailwind's `prefix` option (e.g., `prefix: 'tw-'`) in config
  2. Enable Vuetify's tree-shaking to reduce CSS bloat
  3. Separate usage strategically:
     - Use **Vuetify** for complex components (dialogs, data tables, etc.)
     - Use **Tailwind** for layout and custom styling

### Firebase Authentication v9 getRedirectResult Behavior

- **CRITICAL**: In Firebase v9 modular SDK, `getRedirectResult()` returns `null` when no redirect occurred (not a `UserCredential` object with `null` user).
- **CORRECT**:
  ```typescript
  const result = await getRedirectResult(auth)
  if (result === null) {
    // No redirect occurred
  } else {
    // result is UserCredential
    const user = result.user
  }
  ```
- **INCORRECT**:
  ```typescript
  const result = await getRedirectResult(auth)
  if (result.user === null) {  // ❌ TypeError if result is null
  ```
- **Why**: Always check `result === null` before accessing properties to avoid TypeErrors.

### Firestore Security Rules Are Not Filters

- **CRITICAL**: Firestore security rules are **all-or-nothing**. Queries MUST include the same constraints as security rules.
- **Example**: If your security rule is:
  ```javascript
  allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  ```
- **CORRECT Query**:
  ```typescript
  const q = query(collection(db, 'items'), where('userId', '==', uid))
  ```
- **INCORRECT Query**:
  ```typescript
  const q = query(collection(db, 'items'))  // ❌ Will fail entirely, even if all docs match
  ```
- **Why**: Queries will fail entirely if they don't include the same constraints, even if all documents would pass the security rules.

### Web Worker Testing with @vitest/web-worker

- **CRITICAL**: When testing workers with `@vitest/web-worker`, use `self.onmessage` (not bare `onmessage`).
- **CORRECT**:
  ```typescript
  self.onmessage = (event) => {
    // Worker logic
  }
  ```
- **INCORRECT**:
  ```typescript
  onmessage = (event) => {  // ❌ Breaks with @vitest/web-worker
  ```
- **Why**: The testing library requires explicit `self` reference for proper compatibility.

### Vitest Web Worker and jsdom Incompatibility

- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT combine `environment: 'jsdom'` with `@vitest/web-worker` as it causes dynamic import errors.
- **Solutions**:
  1. Test workers separately with `environment: 'node'`
  2. Use Vitest Browser Mode instead
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // vitest.config.ts
  export default {
    test: {
      // For worker tests
      environment: 'node',  // Not 'jsdom'
    }
  }
  ```
