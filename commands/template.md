## Command Template Structure

### Basic Command Template

```markdown
---
# Frontmatter (Optional but Recommended)
description: Brief description of what this command does
argument-hint: [required-arg] [optional-arg]
allowed-tools: Bash(*), Read(*), Write(*)
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

# Command Title

Brief explanation of the command's purpose and when to use it.

## Instructions

1. **Step 1**: Clear, actionable instruction

   - Use specific language
   - Include expected outcomes

2. **Step 2**: Next logical step

   - Reference files using @filename syntax
   - Execute bash commands using !command syntax

3. **Step 3**: Final steps and verification
   - Always include success criteria
   - Specify expected outputs

## Parameters

- `$ARGUMENTS`: General description of all arguments
- `$1`: First specific parameter description
- `$2`: Second specific parameter description

## Usage Examples
```

/command-name arg1 arg2
/command-name "argument with spaces"

```

## Expected Output
Describe what the user should expect to see when the command completes successfully.
```

### Advanced Command Template with Integration Features

```markdown
---
description: Advanced command with pre-execution and file integration
argument-hint: [github-issue-number] [priority-level]
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*), Bash(gh:*), Read(*), Write(*)
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

# Advanced Integration Command

This command demonstrates advanced features including pre-execution bash commands and file content integration.

## Pre-execution Setup

!git status
!gh auth status

## Main Instructions

1. **Analyze Issue**: Review GitHub issue #$1

   - Priority level: $2 (default: medium)
   - Pull current issue details: `!gh issue view $1`

2. **Review Relevant Files**:

   - Check project configuration: @package.json
   - Review main application: @src/main.js
   - Include recent changes: @CHANGELOG.md

3. **Implementation Strategy**:

   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b fix/issue-$1`
   - Follow TDD approach with test creation first
   - Implement solution with incremental commits

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Run test suite: `!npm run test`
   - Check linting: `!npm run lint`
   - Verify build: `!npm run build`

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Issue requirements fully addressed
- [ ] Code follows project conventions

## Integration Points

- **GitHub**: Automatically fetches issue details
- **Git**: Creates appropriate branch structure
- **npm**: Runs quality checks
- **Project Files**: Incorporates existing patterns
```

## Frontmatter Options Reference

### Essential Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
# Core fields (recommended for all commands)
description: "One-line description of the command's purpose"
argument-hint: "[required] [optional] <choices>"

# Tool permissions (security best practice)
allowed-tools:
  - "Bash(git:*)"           # Allow git commands only
  - "Bash(npm:*)"           # Allow npm commands only
  - "Read(*)"               # Allow reading any files
  - "Write(src/**/*)"       # Allow writing to src directory only
  - "*"                     # Allow all tools (use cautiously)

# Model selection
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022    # For complex tasks
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022     # For simple, fast tasks

# Advanced options
thinking-mode: true        # Enable reasoning display
namespace: project         # Custom namespace (rare usage)
---
```

### Argument Hint Patterns

```yaml
argument-hint: "[required-param]"
argument-hint: "[required] [optional]"
argument-hint: "[file-path] [--option]"
argument-hint: "<high|medium|low> [description]"
argument-hint: "[issue-number] [branch-name=auto]"
```

## Command Categories & Examples

## Best Practices Summary

### ✅ DO:

- Use descriptive, action-oriented command names
- Include clear argument hints and usage examples
- Organize commands by category using subdirectories
- Specify allowed-tools for security
- Use pre-execution commands (`!`) for setup
- Include file content (`@`) for context
- Follow test-driven development principles
- Provide clear success criteria
- Use semantic versioning for command updates
- Share project-specific commands via `.claude/commands/`

### ❌ DON'T:

- Create overly generic commands without clear purpose
- Use confusing or abbreviated command names
- Skip argument validation or error handling
- Allow unrestricted tool access without justification
- Create commands that perform destructive actions without confirmation
- Duplicate functionality across multiple commands
- Skip documentation or usage examples
- Create commands that require manual intervention mid-execution

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Firm Collaboration

```bash
# Project commands are automatically shared
git add .claude/commands/
git commit -m "feat: add custom development commands"
git push

# Firm members get commands automatically
git pull  # Commands now available to entire firm
```

### CI/CD Integration

```markdown
# .claude/commands/deployment/release-prep.md

---

description: Prepare release with automated checks and documentation
allowed-tools: Bash(_), Write(_)

---

# Release Preparation

!git status
!npm run test:ci
!npm run build

1. **Quality Gates**: Ensure all checks pass
2. **Version Bump**: Update package.json and CHANGELOG.md
3. **Documentation**: Update README and API docs
4. **Tag Creation**: Create release tag with notes
```

### Hook Integration

Commands work seamlessly with Claude Code hooks for automated workflows:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": {
      "command": "/project:validate-changes",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```
