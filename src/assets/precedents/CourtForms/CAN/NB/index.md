# New Brunswick Court Forms - Document Discovery
Last updated: 2025-11-18

## Overview

New Brunswick uses **"Discovery documents (no specific form name)"** under **Rules of Court, Rule 31 - Discovery of Documents**. Unlike other provinces, NB doesn't use a unique terminology, but instead uses a numbered series of forms (Forms 31A through 31D) that together govern the discovery process.

The discovery process in New Brunswick centers on the **Affidavit of Documents** (Form 31B), which parties must file within 10 days after receiving a Notice Requiring Affidavit of Documents (Form 31A).

## Key Forms Under Rule 31

New Brunswick's discovery system uses four main forms:

1. **Form 31A** - Notice Requiring Affidavit of Documents (triggers the disclosure obligation)
2. **Form 31B** - Affidavit of Documents (the main disclosure document)
3. **Form 31C** - Request to Inspect Documents
4. **Form 31D** - Request to Admit Documents

## Research Notes

### Discovery Procedure in New Brunswick

**Terminology**: New Brunswick does not use unique terminology like other provinces. The research document notes: "Discovery documents (no specific form name)" - Rules of Court, Rule 31.

**Process**:
1. A party serves **Form 31A** (Notice Requiring Affidavit of Documents) on the opposing party
2. The receiving party must file and serve **Form 31B** (Affidavit of Documents) within **10 days**
3. The Affidavit of Documents lists all relevant documents in three schedules:
   - Schedule 1: Documents being produced
   - Schedule 2: Documents not produced (claiming privilege)
   - Schedule 3: Documents formerly in possession but no longer available
4. Parties use **Form 31C** to request inspection of listed documents
5. Parties use **Form 31D** to request admission of document authenticity

**Comparison to Other Provinces**:
- **Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, PEI**: Use "Affidavit of Documents" (NB uses same term for Form 31B)
- **British Columbia, Newfoundland**: Use "List of Documents" (different approach)
- **Alberta**: Uses "Affidavit of Records"
- **Nova Scotia**: Uses generic "Affidavit disclosing documents"
- **Northwest Territories/Nunavut**: Use "Statement as to Documents"
- **Quebec**: No affidavit or list (civil law system)

**Bilingual Forms**: All official NB court forms are available in both English and French, reflecting New Brunswick's status as Canada's only officially bilingual province.

## Technical Notes

**Automated Download Issues**: All attempted downloads using curl with proper browser headers (User-Agent, Accept, Referer) resulted in "Access denied" responses from both:
- Government of New Brunswick servers (gnb.ca domain)
- Third-party educational sites (jurisource.ca)

This suggests these sites have strong anti-bot protections that require actual browser-based downloads.
