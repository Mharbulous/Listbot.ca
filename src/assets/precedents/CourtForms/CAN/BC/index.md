## Jurisdictional Notes

### Terminology
- **"List of Documents"** - BC's term for discovery document listing (Form 22)
- **NOT** called "Affidavit of Documents" in BC (used in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, etc.)
- **NOT** called "Initial Disclosures" (US federal term)

### Key Rules
- **Rule 7-1**: Primary discovery rule governing Lists of Documents
- **Rule 7-7**: Notice to Admit documents and facts
- **Timing**: 35 days after end of pleading period
- **Ongoing Obligation**: Rule 7-1(9) requires amended lists when new documents obtained

### Discovery Workflow
1. **List of Documents** (Form 22) - within 35 days
2. **Appointment to Examine** (Form 23) - schedule discovery examination
3. **Notice to Admit** (Form 26) - request admissions (optional but strategic)
4. **Examination for Discovery** - oral questioning phase
