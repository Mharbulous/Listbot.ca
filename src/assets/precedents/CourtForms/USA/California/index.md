# California Court Forms - Document Discovery
Last updated: November 18, 2025

## Overview

California uses a two-step discovery model for document production:

1. **Initial Disclosures** (CCP § 2016.090, effective Jan. 1, 2024)
   - NEW requirement allowing parties to demand automatic early disclosure within 60 days
   - **No official Judicial Council form exists yet**
   - Provision sunsets January 1, 2027
   - Attorneys must draft demands based on statutory language

2. **Demands for Inspection/Production** (CCP § 2031.010 et seq.)
   - Also called "Request for Production of Documents"
   - No official Judicial Council form - must use pleading paper format
   - Documents must be labeled with specific request numbers (CCP § 2031.280)
   - Response deadline: 30 days (personal service) or 35 days (mail service)

**Important**: Most discovery documents are NOT filed with the court under California Rule 3.250—they are only served on opposing parties.

## Research Notes

### California-Specific Requirements

1. **No Standardized Production Forms**: Unlike interrogatories (DISC-001, DISC-004), California has NO official Judicial Council forms for Demands for Production. Attorneys must create these using templates or pleading paper.

2. **Document Labeling Requirement**: California uniquely requires documents to be labeled with specific request numbers (CCP § 2031.280), not just produced as kept in ordinary business records.

3. **Initial Disclosures Statute**: CCP § 2016.090 (effective Jan. 1, 2024) allows parties to demand initial disclosures, but no official form exists. This provision sunsets on January 1, 2027.

4. **Not Filed with Court**: Most discovery documents (requests and responses) are NOT filed with the court under California Rule 3.250—they are only served on opposing parties and retained.

5. **Response Deadlines**:
   - 30 days if personally served
   - 35 days if served by mail

6. **Self-Help Resources**: The California Courts Self-Help Center (selfhelp.courts.ca.gov) provides RTF templates for creating and responding to production requests.

### Recent Reforms

- **January 1, 2024**: Initial Disclosures requirement added (CCP § 2016.090)
- **January 1, 2024**: DISC-001 form revised
- **2021**: Self-help templates for production requests and responses published

### Terminology

California uses these specific terms:
- **"Demand for Inspection"** (formal term in CCP § 2031.010)
- **"Request for Production"** (common informal term)
- **"Inspection, copying, testing, or sampling"** (full statutory language)

## Next Steps

To complete the California court forms collection, manually download the documents listed above and save them to this directory using the suggested filenames. Priority should be given to:

1. **Forms 3 & 4** (RTF templates) - May be directly downloadable since they're RTF format
2. **Form 5** (Completed example) - Most useful as a real-world example
3. **Form 6** (Training guide) - Comprehensive educational resource

The official Judicial Council forms (1 & 2) are interrogatories rather than production requests, but may be useful as examples of California's official discovery form formatting.
